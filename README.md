##  Debugging

1. **UI Mode**: Interactive test debugger
   ```bash
   npm run test:ui
   ```

2. **Screenshots**: Check `screenshots/` directory

3. **Trace Viewer**: View detailed test execution
   ```bash
   npx playwright show-trace test-results/traces/trace.zip
   ```

4. **HTML Reports**: Open `playwright-report/index.html`

##  Troubleshooting

1. **Authentication Issues**
   - Check `.env` credentials
   - Delete `auth/user-auth.json` to re-authenticate

2. **Element Not Found**
   - Verify selectors in page objects
   - Increase timeouts in config

3. **Test Stability**
   - Add explicit waits for dynamic elements
   - Ensure test data prerequisites exist

##  Contribution Guidelines

1. Follow Page Object Model pattern
2. Include appropriate error handling
3. Add JSDoc comments and screenshots
4. Update README for significant changes
